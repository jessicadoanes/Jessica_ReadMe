# **Hi, I'm Jessica**


I am a data specialist passionate about providing communities with the resources to utilize data to understand their power within community development. I have more than 5 years of experience in consulting academic, nonprofit, government, and international organizations on all aspects of program design, data analysis, and data visualization and storytelling. I enjoy working with Tableau, Power BI, Python programming (Pandas, API Interactions,) web technologies (HTML/CSS and Bootstrap), STATA, and Nvivo. Currently, I am an Evaluation Consultant supporting 10 communities partnering with Habitat for Humanity International in the Quality of Life Framework Learning Cohort research project.
